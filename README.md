# Full-Stack MERN To-Do Application with Tailwind CSS

This repository contains the code for a full-stack To-Do application built using the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, Node.js) and styled with Tailwind CSS. This project serves as a comprehensive guide for setting up a modern web application, covering both frontend and backend development, as well as deployment strategies.

The application allows users to:

- Add new To-Do tasks.
- View existing To-Do tasks.
- Edit the text of To-Do tasks.
- Mark To-Do tasks as complete or incomplete.
- Delete To-Do tasks.

## Features

**Backend (Node.js, Express.js, MongoDB)**

- **RESTful API:** Implements a robust API for CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations on To-Do items.
- **MongoDB Atlas:** Utilizes MongoDB Atlas for cloud-hosted database management.
- **Mongoose ODM:** Employs Mongoose for elegant MongoDB object modeling.
- **Environment Variables:** Securely manages sensitive information using `dotenv`.
- **ES Modules:** Configured to use modern ES module import syntax.

**Frontend (React, Tailwind CSS)**

- **React Hooks:** Leverages `useState` and `useEffect` for efficient state management and side effects.
- **Tailwind CSS:** Provides a utility-first CSS framework for rapid and responsive UI development.
- **Axios:** Used for making HTTP requests to the backend API.
- **React Icons:** Integrates popular icon libraries for a visually appealing interface.
- **Vite:** Fast build tool for a streamlined development experience.
- **Proxy Configuration:** Handles API requests seamlessly during development.
